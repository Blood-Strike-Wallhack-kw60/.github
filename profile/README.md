## 🧱 What Is a Wallhack in Blood Strike?

A **Wallhack** lets you see enemies through solid surfaces. It’s a type of visual ESP that adds **glow outlines, bone models, or 2D boxes** around other players — even when they’re behind walls, vehicles, or terrain. This means **no more blind corners**, **no more ambushes**, and 100% **information advantage**.
